      "At Qualcomm's NuviaCPU team (a startup they acquired), I helped replace expensive third-party verification software, eliminating $2M in annual costs. I engineered a concurrent architecture that improved data processing speeds by 700% for our 5M+ daily records, while developing half the tool's core functionality that supported projects like the Snapdragon X Elite processor. I also modernized our tech stack with Pydantic/Motor and Vite/TypeScript, implemented a GitLab pipeline that enabled daily releases instead of weekly ones. Working with this former startup team gave me valuable experience in developing sotware for engineers.",

      "Our team needed an internal access management platform, so I took on the implementation challenge. I developed a solution that enabled managers to automate project access provisioning for new employees, significantly reducing onboarding time. The platform transformed a tedious manual process into a streamlined workflow, allowing new team members to become productive immediately rather than waiting days for proper access. This tool quickly became essential to our organization's efficiency.",
