I engineered a concurrent architecture that improved data processing speeds by 700% for our 5M+ daily records, while developing half the tool's core functionality that supported projects like the Snapdragon X Elite processor. I also modernized our tech stack with Pydantic/Motor and Vite/TypeScript, implemented a GitLab pipeline that enabled daily releases instead of weekly ones.
